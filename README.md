# CurrencyConverter

A simple currency converter written in Python — usable via **command-line interface (CLI)** or **graphical user interface (GUI)**.

This project is based on the [Frankfurter.dev](https://www.frankfurter.app/) currency API and was created as a personal exercise to learn and explore Python programming.
